    Mostly confined to the online photography game
    <a href="https://gurushots.com">Gurushots</a> until I work
    out how to take photographs worthy of the public gaze. I think the picture
    at the top of my home page is testament to my skills as a portrait photographer, right?
    I asked them to make 'nice faces'. In his defence, I think this was what Zack
    thought he was doing...üôÑ

    The little guy above was taken at Woburn Safari Park; click <a href="Woburn.html">here</a> for a few
    more from the foot safari - I didn't get as many as I would have liked because
    for the bigger animals you're confined to the car, of course, and I was wedged
    in the rear seat between 2 small bouncy people and their car seats. Not a prime
    position for taking photographs.
