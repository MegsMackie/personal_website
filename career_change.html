    How do you navigate a complete career change later in life?  Is it even possible?
  </h1>

  <p style="font-family:Arial">
    Apart from some early jobs working in retail, most of my working life was
    spent as an administrator - over 20 years in fact.  At some point a manager
    noticed some potential in me, and I ultimately ended up as Data Manager
    for the company, heading up a small team.  This was something I was good at and
    enjoyed.  I was constantly challenged, and enjoyed learning new softwares
    and technologies; but when my first grandson was born I wanted a closer
    relationship, so moved away and had to start over.
  <p style="font-family:Arial">
    Initially, I took a job I thought had some potential for growth.  On the surface
    it had a lot going for it; it was a 10 minute drive away, the offices overlooked
    green fields, the people were friendly.  Sadly, I quickly realised it might
    not be what I hoped.  I stuck with it for 18 months until I got a lucky break when
    my son told me about a job that was available at his firm for an
    embedded software tester.  He had, apparently, informed his managers that while
    I didn't have the skills, qualifications or experience required for the position,
    I could absolutely do the job.  I was 61, and had no idea what an embedded
    software tester was.
  <p style="font-family:Arial">
    Luckily, my son knows me well.  I requested a face-to-face interview as I don't
    do well at telephone interviews (I babble...), which I was granted and somehow
    convinced them that I could do the job and although I had no experience
    I had plenty of transferable skills (this, by the way, is absolutely key)
  <p style="font-family:Arial">
    The learning curve has been steep, including learning a programming language
    in my own time.  My son's faith in me, and the company's trust in his
    judgement wasn't something I was prepared to squander.  I've worked hard
    and learn something new at least once a day.  Yes, with software tester skills
    I would have had a quicker start.  Or even some industry knowledge (a working
    knowledge of how video works might have helped).
  <p style="font-family:Arial">
    So, yes, it is possible to take a new path later in life.  Age shouldn't define
    what you're capable of.  I did have a leg up of course.  Would I have got
    the job without my son?  Honestly, I don't know.  If I could have persuaded them
    to interview me, I think it's possible.  But, yes, I got lucky.
